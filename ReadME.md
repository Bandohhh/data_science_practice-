✅ Completed Work - please bare in mind that this is an ongoing project 

 Credit Risk Model  
- A mini-project that builds a credit-risk (or binary classification) pipeline.  
- Loads data, preprocesses features, trains a classification model, and outputs predictions.  
- Demonstrates use of data-science libraries, model training, and basic evaluation.  

python_tutorial  
- A collection of practice scripts/tutorials — re-visiting Python fundamentals (data structures, control flow, functions, etc.).  
- Useful for reinforcing core Python knowledge before diving into full data pipelines.  


🎯 What I’m Planning / Next Steps

- Improve the **Credit Risk Model** by:  
  - adding **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, and **model evaluation metrics** (ROC / precision-recall / confusion matrix).  
  - saving outputs (plots, metrics) in a dedicated `reports/` folder for reproducibility.  
  - wrapping the code into a modular package structure (`src/`, `tests/`, `data/`, `reports/`).  
  - writing a clear **project README** explaining dataset, assumptions, how to run, and interpretation of results.

- Expand coverage in **python_tutorial** by:  
  - building small, testable data-analysis scripts (e.g., EDA, data cleaning, plotting).  
  - adding unit tests or notebooks showing usage examples.  

- Add **documentation and metadata**:  
  - include a `requirements.txt` or environment specification for reproducibility.  
  - document dependencies, dataset sources, and any data-privacy/ethics notes (if needed).  

- Adopt **version control hygiene**:  
  - add `.gitignore` (if not already fully working) to skip environment folders, caches, large data dumps.  
  - tag “releases” at meaningful milestones (e.g. v0.1, v1.0) to track progress.

## 🗒 Why This Repo Exists

I created this repository to give myself a space to:

- Experiment with data-science workflows without constraints  
- Practice building end-to-end models (data load → preprocess → model → evaluate)  
- Keep track of my skill improvement over time  
- Produce sharable, reviewable code that can be used for coursework or personal projects  

## 📦 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bandohhh/data_science_practice-.git
cd data_science_practice-
